# Physics Video Player

## Description:
The physics video player is an HTML5 replacement for traditional OS specific media players (such as VLC or Windows Media Player). It uses Chrome's native video playback functionality to provide a way to watch and manipulate locally-stored videos. Supported file types include webm, mp4, mp3, and ogg. It also includes functionality to assist in making measurements of motion in videos: a graphing tool, a point logger, and a method to increment videos by individual frames.

## Requirements:
Chrome 49+
